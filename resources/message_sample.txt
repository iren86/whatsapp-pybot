Hey!
A concerned student comes to talk with his teacher.

The teacher thinks for a little while and says, "perhaps you should try a generator expression".

A constant variable enters in a bar, and says to the barman.
- I want your best Whisky and I wanted right now!
The barman replies:
- I don't know who do you think you are pal, but we treat everybody the same.
So, How it is called the bar?
... Python
